 Implementation of a Asynchronous FIFO(First In First Out) using Verilog (Self Project)
 
∗ Design involves handling the Read and Write operations of data using the different clock frequencies,featuring robust
pointer handling and keeping in track of Full and Empty condition to prevent overflow and underflow.
∗ Gray code pointer implementation to minimize error during Clock domain Crossing(CDC).
∗ The implementation was verified through testbenches to ensure accurate and efficient data handling within digital
systems.
∗ Tool Used- EDA Playground
